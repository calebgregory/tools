## prefer-reference-over-restatement

When documenting anything — code, configuration, processes, systems — link to the canonical source rather than restating what it says. This applies to READMEs, comments, docstrings, and any explanatory prose.

Duplication creates a sync burden: now two things must be kept in agreement. Instead, tell the reader *where* to look, not *what* they'll see. Trust that the source material is readable.
